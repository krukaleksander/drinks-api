# DRINKS API

## About project

I did this project in order to demonstrate my ability to use an external API. 
My Drinks API is fetching data from [TheCoctailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). 

### How it works

You can get random drink, from massive CoctailDB, or search infrmation about your favourite drink. 

### What I used

* SCSS
* TypeScript
* npm - only to get normalize.css
* HTML structure build with BEM convention
